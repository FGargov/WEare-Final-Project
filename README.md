# WEare social network

**Project Description**

The task is to develop a SOCIAL NETWORK web application.

## Prerequisites
- Java SDK 11
- jUnit 5
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system

## Installation Steps

In order to use the framework:

1. Install Git:

If you haven't installed Git on your system, you can download and install it from here.
Clone the Repository:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
1. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Clone the Repository., i.e, download your copy of the repository to your local machine using
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Final-Project-Telerik-Academy/WEare.git
```
3. Explore the project structure and files using your preferred code editor or IDE.
4. Start and access the application  from WeareApplication.class with your IDE, it will typically be accessible via a web browser. The default address is usually http://localhost:8081/, but this might vary based on the project configuration.
## Languages and Frameworks

The project uses the following:

- *[Java 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/)* as the programming language.
- *[Maven](https://maven.apache.org)* as project management and comprehension tool.
- *[Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/)* as the web browser automation framework using the Java binding.
- *[jUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)* as the testing framework.
- *[Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)* to generate getters.
- *[Allure Reports](https://allurereport.org)* as the test reporting strategy for REST Assured and Selenium.

- *[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)* as the IDE.


## Requirements


## Reporting
### Newman
A *[Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman-reporter-htmlextra)* HTML reporter that has been extended to include the separation of the iteration runs so these are no longer aggregated together and also some additional handlebars helpers to enable users to create better custom templates.
#### Install
The reporter works as a plugin with Newman so ensure that you have already installed that package globally, using *npm install -g newman.*
To globally install the htmlextra package:
```
npm install -g newman-rep
```
To globally install the htmlextra package:
```
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

#### Usage
1. Run the Postman collection specified in collection.json.
2. Use the environment variables from environment.json.
3. Generate a report using the htmlextra reporter, which provides an enhanced HTML report of the run.
```
newman run collection.json -e environment.json -r htmlextra
```

The command runs the Postman collection from collection.json 10 times using variables from environment.json. It produces an enhanced HTML report with a progress bar. Each request has a 3-second timeout, and scripts have a 1-second timeout. If exceeded, they're terminated as failures.
```
newman run collection.json -e environment.json -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-displayProgressBar --iteration-count 10 --timeout-request 3000 --timeout-script 1000
```
You can execute Newman directly from these two script files in Postman folder in the project:
For Linux:
1. Navigate to the "Postman" directory within the project.
2. Open a terminal in this directory.
3. Write in terminal one of these commands: 

```
./run.sh

```
or
```
./run10.sh
```
- **run.sh** - This script will execute the basic command.

- **run10.sh** - This script will execute 10 times the command with additional parameters.

4. Ð¢he test report will appear in a folder named 'Newman' in the same directory.

For Windows:

Double-click on the desired batch file to run it. The pause command at the end of each batch file will keep the command prompt window open so you can view the results.

Alternatively, you can also run the batch files from the Command Prompt. Navigate to the directory containing the batch files and type the name of the batch file you want to run, followed by pressing Enter.
./run.sh

```
run.bat
```
or
```
run10.bat
```
### Allure Reports
Allure Report is a flexible, lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only shows a very concise representation of what has been tested in a neat web report form, but also allows for a deeper test debugging by providing logs, steps, fixtures, attachments, timings, and more. It's designed to create clear and comprehensive test reports that are easy to read and understand.

For the *installation* of Allure Reports, follow these detailed instructions:
